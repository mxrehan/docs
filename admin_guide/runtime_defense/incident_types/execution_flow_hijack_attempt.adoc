== Execution Flow Hijack Attempt

A execution flow hijack attempt incident indicates that a possible attempt to hijack a program execution flow was observed. Special Linux library system files, which have a system wide affect, were altered (this is usually undesirable, and is typically employed only as an emergency remedy or maliciously).

=== Investigation

The following incident shows that the binary sudo wrote to ld.so.preload File, which is a special Linux system file that impacts the entire system.

=== Mitigation

A full mitigation strategy for this incident begins with resolving the issues that allowed the attacker to modify the system file. 

Ensure that compliance benchmarks are appropriately applied to the affected resources. For example, if the critical file systems in the host are mounted read-only, it will be more difficult for an attacker to change a configuration to their advantage.
